# fiveparsecs
This is a personal project to develop a companion program for Five Parsecs from Home. It's also my first ever useful-ish program ever, so pardon the trash code throughout.

Right now, it's a prototype primarily focused on quickly generating characters and updating their attributes and inventories based on the character generation tables found in the core rule book of Five Parsecs from Home.

The intention of this project is NOT to replace the need for the core rulebook. It's simply to assist with book keeping and let players spend more time with their miniatures at the table.
